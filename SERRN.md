# SERRN
### SQL SERVER / Express / React / Redux / NodeJS

### Reasons to use SERRN

#### NodeJS
- a collaborative project of the Linux Foundation
- event based
- non-blocking, uses cores instead of threads
- very scalable
- can handle thousands of concurrent connections
- built on Google's V8 engine
    - (a JavaScript and WebAssembly engine written in C++)
- cross-platform
- great for real-time apps
- has a package for virtually any need
- is used by many Fortune500 companies:
    - Netflix
    - LinkedIn
    - Walmart
    - Trello
    - Uber
    - Paypal
    - eBay
    - NASA
    - Google
    - Microsoft
    - Mozilla
    - GitHub

#### React
- created by Facebook & Instagram, open-source
- component-based (reusable modules)
- uses a "Virtual DOM" which allows for very fast rendering
    - only reloads sections that have changed using a diff algorithm
- pretty easy to learn
- has a Chrome debug extension
- it can iterate over sets of data in Redux state and can create custom templates for each item much like Angular.js' ng-repeat with ES6's .map function (but it is faster and easier to add conditional rendering)
- used by:
    - Facebook
    - Instagram
    - Netflix
    - WhatsApp
    - Dropbox
    - Pinterest
    - Airbnb
    - Twitter
    - Uber
    - Pandora
    - Reddit
    - Venmo
    - Tesla
    - Walmart

#### Redux
- immutable state that lives in one store and can be accessed anywhere in the application, is not stored in local storage
- state is read-only
- state can only be modified through pure functions, which always return a new state, not modifying the original
- follows the principles of the functional programming paradigm
- used by:
    - Postman
    - Netflix
    - Instagram
    - OpenTable
